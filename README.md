# DemographicDataAnalyzer
*Free code Camp Demographic Data Analyzer Project* 

# The Project
In this challenge I had to write a function that would analyze demographic data. The data consisted of Census data obtained in 1994. I would parse through the data in order to address the questions provided by free code camp.

# The Process
The questions I need to answer were given to me, so the process was much easier this time around. What decided to do was sudo code the function question after question using Pandas and statistics. You will see this done in the following notebook: https://github.com/bmor2552/DemographicDataAnalyzer/blob/master/DataAnalysis_Practice.ipynb

Once the questions were all answered I put the code all under one function. From there I used outside resources to help clean up my code. 

# The Conclusion 
While working on this challenge I was able to practice reading a csv file into a df using pandas, as well as parse through the df to locate needed information using pandas.Â
